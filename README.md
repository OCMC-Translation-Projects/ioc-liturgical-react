The ioc-liturgical-react package provides React js components for creating web applications that access the International Orthodox Christian (IOC) Liturgical Web Service (ioc-liturgical-ws). The web service provides a REST API as a front-end to the IOC Liturgical Database (ioc-liturgical-db).  The components provided by this package include:

1. Login - a React component that renders a login form and handles the submit by interacting with the REST API.

Components are to come in the near future.

## Usage

Use npm to install the ioc-liturgical-react package.

When you import a component into your Javascript, use braces around the name of the component, e.g.

import {Login} from 'ioc-liturgical-react'
